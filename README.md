# GS Lite

GS Lite is a lightweight version of the Salesforce GS Lightning console used by VMware technical support engineers. GS Lite intends to capitalize on some of the design gaps seen in the traditional Lightning console by eliminating the need for tabs, centralizing ticket data, and cutting out unnecessary e-mail bloat. 

GS Lite supports the ability to quickly look up other support engineer's tickets, message customers back in a manner that mirrors Salesforce Lightning messaging functionality, as well as allows the simultaneous download of multiple case attachments. Finally, GS Lite brings the essentials of ticket review and response to mobile, enabling technical support engineers to work on the go.
